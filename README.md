👋 Hi, I’m Ernesto and can help you managing your most important projects 🎯
I am an Industrial Engineer with over 18 years of professional experience including 3 years international experience in England and have strong project and team management skills in several fields.
Currently, I make projects in these areas:
🔹Data Science and Data Analytics, specifically projects in Python for Business Intelligence, Machine and Deep Learning, always without losing sight of the business application
🔹Digital transformation, always with the customer at the center and transforming from the core (business model) outwards, and not the other way around (digitization)
🔹New technologies such as IoT, Industry 4.0, digital twins, software of various kinds, IT in general
🔹Process Improvement


🖥️ I'm looking for projects in all these fields.
🌱 I continue improving my project manager skills
💞️ I love to LEARN. I prefer questions requiring data analysis, provided I can combine them with an ability to plan, decide and manage. Logical and rational, I am also dynamic, persuasive and with a good business head on my shoulders. I combine a keen sense of observation and logic with a great eye for detail to achieve the desired result. In addition, I consider myself a good workmate and a close and kind person.
